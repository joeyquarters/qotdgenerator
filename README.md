# Question of the Day Generator

I made a simple static site because the trainers at my gym can never think of a good question of the day. Hopefully this will inspire them.

## Building

To build the site, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command:
* Cleans the `_site` folder
* Compiles templates
* Copies the CSS

### Built With

* [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/)
